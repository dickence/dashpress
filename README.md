[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/aO500EjHw1c/mqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/aO500EjHw1c)


### Motivation
Most internal tool applications make you build from the ground up i.e you get a blank canvas, drag and drop components, and wire them together with SQL and Javascript/Python to satisfy your business requirement. This I believe has many problems.

- They require some technical knowledge. 
- They require some learning curve. 
- They require time to build.
- You duplicate a lot of business logic already in your database.
- You to maintain them. 

DashPress attempts internal tool generation with a new approach by introspecting your database and building a multi-page application based on all the info it can find like your field types, relationships, constraints etc. You literally can have your admin app done in seconds without any tutorial or coding.
